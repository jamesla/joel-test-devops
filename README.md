## The Joel Test for Devops

I am a big fan of Joel Spolskys "The Joel Test" a self confessed 'highly irresponsible, sloppy test to rate the quality of a software team'. https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/

Since there is currently a lot of change with how companies manage infrastructure, I thought I would adapt The Joel Test and its 2017 update by Dale Myers https://myers.io/2017/04/04/the-joel-test-for-2017/ to work for people who look after infrastructure within Devops environments.

As per Joel's test, each question is worth one point:

1. Does all infrastructure code go through review?
1. Are all new systems designed before they are built?
1. Is most infrastructure tested automatically?
1. Is most infrastructure hosted in a public cloud?
1. Is most infrastructure deployed automatically?
1. Does your infrastructure automatically scale?
1. Do most systems log to a centralised logging system?
1. Do you have coding standards?
1. Do you use an issue tracker?
1. Are bugs fixed before writing new code?
1. Do you have up to date information on performance and usage?
1. Do you have an up-to-date project schedule?
